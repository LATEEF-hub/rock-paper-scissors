## Features:

- **Interactive Game** The game offers an interactive gaming experience, allowing the player to choose an answer and received a response straight back. 

- **Random Choice** The player is presented with 3 Random choice questions of ROCK.PAPER.SCISSORS. Each answer determing if you will or lose. 

- **Informative** If the player lose a round, the game tells the player they got it wrong and that the opponent wins. 

- **Play Again Feature** Once the player finished a round, they are giving the option of playing again. 

## Design:

- I originally designed a rough flow chart with a very simple design. Once the website was built and was working made some changes to make it flow better and give the player a better experience.

## Testing:

- I have manaully tested the project using CI Python Linter with no errors showing.

- I have used bothe my local termianl and the Heroku website to run the quiz with no errors showing up. 

## Bugs:

- I encountered a bug at the begining of the project on how to use the Enum for my permanent representation of choice of RPS. I had to use stackoverflow website.
- From the above bug I couldn't find a way to represent my user input and the option of what the player might enter as Strings. No matter what  I tried it I kept getting errors. This is something I wish to look at again when I have more experience with Python.
- Because input() returns a string, I need to convert the return value to an integer using int(). Then, I can compare the input to each of the actions. This works well, but it might rely on me naming variables correctly in order to keep track of them. A better way is to use enum.IntEnum and define my own action class!
- Using enum.Enum allows me to create attributes and assign them values similar to those shown in the game. This helps clean up my code by grouping actions into their own namespaces and making the code more expressive.

## Remaining Bugs:

- No Bugs remaining 

## Deployment:

This project was deployed using Heroku. 
- steps for deployment:
    - Create a new Heroku app
    - Set the builds pack to Python and NodeJS in that order
    - Link the Heroku app to my repository
    - Click Deploy

## Credits:

- The Code Institute Love-Sandwiches Project help me learn a lot about Python. 

- The (www.w3schools.com) website helped with trying to figure out how to use the correct code and how to get it to work for me.
- The Stackoverflow website helped with using Enum

- Real Python (https://realpython.com/) - When I was really struggling I was able to  look up few steps from the website 

## Content:

- The ASCII came from the (www.asciiart.eu) website. 
- Flow Chart was designed using the (https://Lucid.app/) website
